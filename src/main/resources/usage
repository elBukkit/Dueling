Thank you for using HPDueling!
Here are the usages if they come unclear.
Creating an arena:
1. Create an arena name.
2. Stand where you want the spawn to be. (Can be changed later but it is easier if you just do it now.)
3. Create the arena by doing /dueling admin create <arena name> (arena type, ffa, spleef, 1v1, 2v2, 3v3)
4. Once you have created the arena you can now set the options.
5. Set the lobby where you are standing by /options setlobby <arena name>
6. Set the spawn where you are standing by /options setspawn <arena name>
7. Set the spectator room where you are standing by /options setspec <arena name>
8. Set the treasure room where you are standing by /options settreasureroom <arena name>
9. Set the minimum amount of players to start the arena by /options setminplayers <arena name> <int ammount> (Default:2)
10. Set the max amount of players that can join the arena by /options setmaxplayers <arena name> <int ammount> (Default:6)
11. Congratulations you have created your first arena!
12. To have players join this arena create a sign.
13. The sign should look like this:
               Duel
               <Arena name>
14. Then it will 'auto form' the sign and allow players to join when they right click.
15. Remember more is to come so there will be things that will have to be updated!
